# Queues

- Queues are FIFO or first-in first-out ordering, meaning the first element added will always be the first to be removed.
- Queues are handy when you need to maintain the order of your elements to process later.

## Common Operations
Let's establish a protocol for queues:

    public protocol Queue {
        associatedtype Element
        mutating func enqueue(_ element: Element) -> Bool
        mutating func dequeue() -> Element?
        var isEmpty: Bool { get }
        var peek: Element? { get }
    }

The protocol describes the core operations for a queue:
- **enqueue**: Insert an element at the back of the queue. Returns true if the operation was successful.
- **dequeue**: Remove the element at the front of the queue and return it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **peek**: Return the element at the front of the queue without removing it.


Notice that the queue only cares about removal from the front and insertion at the
back. You donâ€™t need to know what the contents are in between. If you did, you
would probably just use an array.

## Array-Based Queue
There are multiple ways to implement Queues in Swift. One of them is by leveraging Array.
