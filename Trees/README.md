# Trees
The tree is an important data structure and is used for various purposes in software development, such as:

- Representing hierarchical relationships
- Facilitating fast lookup operations
- Managing sorted data

## Node
A tree is made up of nodes. Each node can carry some data and keeps track of its chilren.

## Parent and child
Trees are viewed starting from the top and branching towards the bottom, just like a real tree, only upside-down. Every node (except for the topmost one) connects to exactly one node above it. That node is called a **parent** node. The nodes directly below and connected to it are called its **child** nodes. In a tree, every child has exactly one parent. That's what make a tree, well, a tree.
