# Queues

- Queues are FIFO or first-in first-out ordering, meaning the first element added will always be the first to be removed.
- Queues are handy when you need to maintain the order of your elements to process later.

## NOTE
- A queue only cares about removal from the front and insertion at the back.
- You don't need to know what the contents are in between.
- If you did, you would probably just use an array.
